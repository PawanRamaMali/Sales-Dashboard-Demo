# Shiny-Dashboard-Template
I have seen a ton of examples for either [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) or [Shiny Dashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) apps 
with all of the code living in either one file, or two files (ui and server).
I like to modularize my code in a way that's manageable, and easy to break out or re-use.

**With that being said**, I created this repo to serve as a template for Shiny Dashboard apps. Basic and simplistic file structure. If there is anything I missed, feel free to create a pr :) Like I said, this is a template/boilerplate. 

### Get It Running
1. Make sure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html) installed *(Pretty important step in this process lol)*

2. Through your favorite R interface, be sure you `install.packages` for both shiny and shinydashboard.

3. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/PawanRamaMali/Sales-Dashboard-Demo` 

4. You should be good to go!! Make sure your cwd is set to this folder level of this repo. run `shinyApp()` in your console, or click the `Run App` button in RStudio.


Good luck, and happy coding :)
